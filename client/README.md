# React/Typescript Client

The `client` directory contains the frontend for the Boggle project. It is a React/Typescript frontend.

## Implementation Notes
The bulk of game logic is performed on the server, but some initial validation is done on the client. See `src/components/matrix.tsx` for the bulk of the client-side logic.
